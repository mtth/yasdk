# YASDK

Yet another TypeScript OpenAPI SDK generator

## Why?

+ Concise API with (very) strong typing guarantees
+ Dependency-free single-file generated SDK (less than 2kB)
+ Pluggable `fetch` implementation, without patching the global object

Refer to [`yasdk`](/packages/yasdk)'s README for more information, including
examples.

## Developing

```sh
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm dlx husky install # Set up git hooks, only needed once
```
