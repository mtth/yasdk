# YASDK

Yet another TypeScript SDK generator

## Why?

+ Single-file dependency-free generated SDK (<3kB uncompressed)
+ Concise API with (very) strong typing guarantees
+ Pluggable `fetch` implementation without patching the global object

## Developing

```sh
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm dlx husky install # Set up git hooks, only needed once
```
